I&#39;m Da Eun.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />And I&#39;m Sophia. Today, we&#39;re super excited to have two friends share their stories competing in beauty pageants. So I did a bit of research on beauty pageants., The industry has grown into a 5 billion a year industry, according to pageant news bureau. And an estimated 3000 pageants around the world draw over 250000 entrants a year. And parents will spend thousands and thousands to support their daughters competing in pageants. So growing up, I personally never followed beauty pageants because I was pretty pessimistic that pageants in the US would give visibility to women who were beautiful beyond those with a typical blonde hair and blue-eyed look.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />But my thoughts on beauty pageants changed a little bit when I met Crystal Lee, who is a Chinese-American pageant winner, and she paid for her bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s at Stanford with pageant money, which I thought was super impressive. She is a former Miss California and runner up to Miss America. And her platform was advancing women in STEM. And she believes that pageants are really empowering because it gives women a platform to be celebrated for both their beauty and the brilliance. So I sort of following her on Instagram because I was really curious about her life, but I was still reluctant to show my support for pageants because I know they have some problematic origins. And then I saw that a childhood friend, was competing in a Miss World America, and that her platform was also to support women in STEM. So Priscilla and I have had some awesome conversations about what that journey has been like. And we&#39;re super excited that she&#39;s on the podcast today to be sharing that journey with you all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />Yes. We&#39;re really happy to have you. And we also have Savannah with us. As for my take on this topic, I&#39;m also in a similar position as Sophia, where I also never really paid attention to beauty pageants. And I think it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t really know about an Asian-American participating in them. So it was out of sight, out of mind. And there were a few people at my high school, actually, who won titles at beauty pageants, but they weren&#39;t in my immediate circle. And I viewed them as very different people from me. But when I went to college, I found out that an acquaintance at the time, but now one of my best friends, Heather, was actually Miss America Teen Rhode Island when she was in high school. And she&#39;s Asian-American.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />And so I&#39;ve continued to be more exposed to people like her, as well as Savannah taking on beauty pageants and hearing about their experiences as women of color who tend to be very heavily underrepresented in the industry. And I have known Savannah to be a super strong, badass woman who also really heavily involved herself in the Asian-American community at Stanford, while also pursuing her research in mental health within our community. So naturally, this is also her platform in the beauty pageant she&#39;s participated in. And I&#39;m excited to have her and Priscilla join us for this special episode. And now, if you two would like to introduce yourselves really quickly, Priscilla first and then maybe Savannah second, we&#39;re excited to hear more about your experiences.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Thank you so much for the great introduction. Sophia, my name is Priscilla Wang and I am a software engineer by day and a beauty queen by night. I recently competed in the Miss World America system back in October and I placed top twenty five overall and top five in the talent portion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />Great! Thanks for having me on the show. My name is Savannah Pham. I am currently a PhD student in clinical psychology and I have competed in four pageants. I recently won the title of Miss Asia World. I&#39;ve also competed in the Miss Asian American system, have held titles as Miss Vietnam USA and competed in some local pageants when I was in college.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Awesome. So thank you for your introduction and I would love to hear from both of you: what is your favorite part of competing in a pageant?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br /> My favorite part of competing in pageants has always been meeting other strong and like-minded women who are very ambitious and also really committed to breaking down stereotypes about what it means to compete in a pageant. So I&#39;m always so inspired and motivated by these women and also love having the opportunity to have a platform that is extremely unique.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Yeah, like Savannah. I also love, love meeting other women who are highly ambitious, but they also have a passion to help their community. So a lot of the girls that I have met have contributed a lot of their time towards, you know, volunteering for organizations such as the Boys and Girls Club or other organizations that help improve the community.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />That&#39;s awesome to hear. And it&#39;s cool to see this be a community of very strong women who share similar passions about helping their communities and helping other people. I have a follow up question: how did you come to decide to even participate in your first beauty pageant? And did you go into your first beauty pageant knowing and seeking out that community of highly ambitious women?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />I decided to compete in my first pageant when I was 19. I was a sophomore in college and I was going through sophomore slump at the time and doing a beauty pageant was something that I had never, ever seen myself doing. But it was a local Vietnamese pageant for college girls and I had really wanted to get out of my comfort zone and also meet other Vietnamese women in the community. So it was a really great way to do that and get connected with community organizations and other women. But I had never expected that my pageant journey would take me this far and that it would be full of the experiences that it has been. Because when I started, I had the same stereotypes about pageants that I think a lot of people do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br /> For me, I started competing this year. So it is November now, I started competing in June. Basically, I just saw an advertisement for a preliminary that allows you to qualify to be at nationals. And I thought, you know, I&#39;m just gonna challenge myself because it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve never done before. But I know that I&#39;ve grown the most when I did something that I was super scared of. So I am a software engineer now. But back in the day, back in high school, I was like, there&#39;s no way for me to become a software engineer. But when I was in college, I saw it as a challenge. And I decided to tackle that challenge because I knew it was going to help me grow. So I use that same mentality when I entered my first pageant back in June. I was like, you know what? I know nothing about this, but it&#39;s really challenging. And I know this is gonna help me grow as a person. And back then, I did not know about the community that comes with it, like Savannah - I kind of just went in not knowing anything about it, but I made a lot of really, really great friends along the way. A lot of them have the same passion as me. And so it&#39;s really great to have that network of girls who are just highly supportive of one another.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br /> So both of you didn&#39;t see yourself originally being people who would participate in beauty pageants, which was a motivator for you to go out and do in the first place. Did you find that other people that you met at beauty pageants have a similar motivation as well? What are the differences between the kinds of people that you&#39;ve met and participated in these beauty pageants with?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />I think with any activity, you meet a wide range of people. And because I&#39;ve competed in four pageants in four systems and at four different levels, I&#39;ve met a really wide range of people. There are some women who also are coming in with the mentality that this is a way to meet other people who are strong and like-minded, and that this is a way to kind of further your own self-growth and confidence. It&#39;s also a great way to network. But then you also meet some people who have been competing since they&#39;re very young or are really experienced in the system and kind of going with the mindset that, I&#39;m going to to be nice to you, but at the same time, I&#39;m really here for one reason and one reason only. I can&#39;t say that&#39;s the majority of people. But I do think that people are coming in with different intentions. But for the most part, people are really coming in wanting to better themselves and meet other people and better their communities.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />What about you, Priscilla?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Yeah, I have similar experiences as Savannah. I do have to say, though, like even though everybody comes in with a really different background, it&#39;s incredible to see how everybody is just as nervous about how they&#39;re going to do on stage. So no matter how experienced they are in the pageant world, you never know who&#39;s going to win because it really depends on who is judging on that specific day. So, yeah, it&#39;s really interesting to see how the most experienced people still have that nervous energy around them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Yeah, bringing it back to what you both said, which is you participated in this pageant looking for growth opportunities.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>replace Priscilla </h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br /> What were different components of the pageants that you both competed in and which components for you each really excited for and thought you were really prepared for and which were the components that you were more nervous for? Senator</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br /> So for the Miss World Organization, we have the evening gown, we have fitness wear, we have our Beauty with a Purpose, and we have the social media challenge. So Beauty with a Purpose is how Miss World categorizes the &quot;platform&quot; part of pageantry. Basically, each girl is supposed to have a beauty with a purpose. So that is your cause and your platform and what you do to contribute to the world. So for me, that was my favorite part because like that&#39;s the portion where I really get to give back to my community. So my whole platform is on bringing more diversity into the tech industry through accessible STEM education. And as Miss World, Oklahoma - that&#39;s a title I hold under the Miss World America Organization - I actually went to one of the STEM expos to try to urge kids to enter, you know, STEM education. There are so many girls and kids of color there who, you know, they didn&#39;t know what STEM was about. And there is no good support system for them to learn and create a community within STEM subjects. So I was there to show them that, hey, there are a lot of great resources out there. I spent a lot of my time volunteering for organizations such as Girls Who Code an All Star Code. And there are a lot of grants and free resources that will help them pursue that education. So that was my favorite part of competing in the pageant. The part that I was the most nervous about was definitely the evening gown and fitness wear walk. I have never been a super confident person when it comes to like posing and walking. Those two are the portions that I really had to try hard and practice, practice, practice before nationals came around. I think I did OK. I challenged myself and I definitely have improved since I started a few months ago.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />What about you, Savannah? Because I know you said that you&#39;ve been in like four different pageants, so what were the categories for each of those and were they all pretty similar? And I was just piggybacking off of Sophia&#39;s question as well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />Because I&#39;ve competed in either Asian focus or Vietnamese focused ones, we have similar things. So, you have your platform, evening gown, fitness wear. But we also have a cultural component which is modeling your cultural attire as well as Q&amp;As and interviews. And then I think for me, the part that&#39;s always the most challenging is talent, because I don&#39;t have your very stereotypical pageant talent. If that makes sense, a lot of people are so good at playing an instrument or dancing or something, but I never had the opportunity to really have lessons in any of those things growing up. So something that I had to do on my own was to figure out what my talent could be, and it was spoken word. And that was something that I was absolutely terrified of showing to other people, because that&#39;s, again, something that&#39;s not super common in the pageant world. So that&#39;s something I kind of had to -</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />That&#39;s so cool! Can we find your spoken word online? Is it on YouTube.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />I can send you a video that I have!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />I really love to watch!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />But yeah... it was rough. So that&#39;s something that I&#39;ve kind of had to take ownership of and be proud of and be like, this is who I am, I wish I could do other things as well, but that&#39;s something I had to kind of figure out. And then I think my favorite parts of the pageants that I&#39;ve competed in, similar to Priscilla, is just having that very unique platform to engage in something that I&#39;m already doing on a broader level. When I was an undergrad and now as a PhD student, my research really revolves around how can me eliminate mental health disparities and how can be better the mental health among ethnic minorities. So that&#39;s something that I really work on: incorporating my passionate work is how can I really work with community organizations and community members to break down that stigma that, especially in the Asian-American community, we have around mental illness. So competing in pageants has given me the opportunity to collaborate with FBI, Dallas Police Department on how can we actually tackle this issue in a way that systematic and also is going to ultimately provide the best care and treatment for our community. So that&#39;s been the most powerful and most rewarding experiences for me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />That&#39;s incredible, because both of you, like Priscilla, you&#39;re a software engineer and you know, you&#39;re a PhD student studying this. And it&#39;s so cool to see that this beauty pageant isn&#39;t just like a side thing. It is very much also like an extension of being able to continue what your passion is as well and using it as a tool to better your communities and have other outlets to have outreach towards other people. So that&#39;s really incredible in my opinion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br /> In what ways do you think competing in a pageant gives you unique opportunities to advance your platform? And, now that you&#39;ve gone through a pageant, what are some limitations that you&#39;ve observed?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />I think a big thing for me is that in whatever pageant you compete in, it&#39;s all about how much you&#39;re willing to put yourself out there, because the pageant organization can only do so much to give you a network or to provide you access with these opportunities. But I found that it&#39;s really on me to leverage those connections to actually do something with it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br /> Sometimes when you&#39;re networking with these organizations, they will look at you as just a pretty face. So it&#39;s kind of coming at them with your credentials, you know, like as a PhD student, like Priscilla, you&#39;re software engineer, like you have to show people that although, you know, you may have this title and they may have these stereotypes about what that means, that you have the credentials, you have the background and experience to actually allow you to use this platform in a way that&#39;s going to be helpful. So I think it comes with its pros and cons.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />What about you, Priscilla?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br /> So something that I&#39;ve noticed is that I am an engineer and I&#39;m so used to being the one who is doing things, right? I like, you know, roll up my sleeves and I do the volunteering, I do the managing, I do the organizing for all of these organizations and nonprofits that I volunteer for. But as a title holder, as someone who is Miss &quot;Something Something,&quot; you&#39;re kind of seen as a leader who doesn&#39;t really do anything - you&#39;re there to just INSPIRE. And so that&#39;s something that I&#39;m still trying to get used to. I&#39;m trying to learn how to inspire people just by speaking, not only by doing so. So your question about limitations got me thinking about that.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>Remove "also" and add a space</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Also, another interesting difference between your two pageants is that Savannah, it sounds like you were competing, were you mostly competing against other Vietnamese women in your pageants?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />So two of the ones I competed in were solely for Vietnamese women, and then two of them were for Asian International.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Ok, gotcha. Because I&#39;m super curious how your experiences differ, because for Priscilla, you were competing not only against like Taiwanese-American or like Asian-American folks. And I&#39;m really curious what kind of implicit biases you to have observed based on the pageants that you participated in, like for Priscilla. What do you think are some biases that the pageant industry in the US has about Asian-American women?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">What is it like for you as a Taiwanese-American woman for your appearance to be compared against people who are not Asian-American? And then, Savannah, for you I&#39;m just curious how your experience is knowing that your appearance is being compared to other Asian-American women.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>revisit endof this </h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Ok. I can go first. In the national competition where you compete against 49 other states, the range of girls are going to be really, really wide. You have girls where a super Caucasian, you have girls who are black, you have girls who are Asian.  y biggest challenge is getting my makeup and hair right. Because the way that white people have their hair and makeup done, it really only works on them. And it doesn&#39;t really work on Asians because like our eyes are shaped a little bit differently. So we can&#39;t use these like really, really thick eyelashes. That&#39;s like one example. So for me, that was the biggest challenge: trying to look like a pageant girl without using the same technique as those girls. And I think, unfortunately, America&#39;s perception of girl next door is still, you know, the blonde girl with a really sweet smile. And in an American pageant, they&#39;re still looking for America&#39;s sweetheart. So that&#39;s another challenge that we as people of color, as Asian-Americans, as Taiwanese-American like myself, need to overcome. We need to make sure that the girl next door is not just the blonde girl with blue eyes. They can also be an Asian girl who is super, super smart. That&#39;s the kind of stereotype that I&#39;m trying to break. Does that answer the question?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />That&#39;s great!  Were you given makeup and falsies to use or did you go out and purchase your own?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />So you can use their makeup crew, but I chose to not use them because from my experience, people who have never really worked with Asians, they don&#39;t know how to put makeup on us. My friends who are black or African-American, they&#39;ve had really, really terrible experiences where the makeup artists aren&#39;t able to match their skin tone. So they look really, really washed out on stage.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">I watch a lot of like Asian American beauty YouTubers talk about how the inclusivity of all of these brands is not quite up to par. And so it&#39;s really interesting that you experienced this firsthand and like your other pageant sisters are also experienced this firsthand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah. And it&#39;s really nice to have these conversations with the pageant sisters because like you realize that it&#39;s a problem that all of us different people of color have. So it&#39;s a really common problem. And it&#39;s nice to know that you&#39;re not alone.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />Mhmm. And then what about you, Savannah, since you are competing in primarily Asian or Vietnamese centric beauty pageants? Is there anything that you personally noticed that might have not been represented in other beauty pageants that people are more familiar with, Like Miss American or Miss World? </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br /> The reason why I decided to compete in strictly Vietnamese or Asian-American Asian international pageants is because I grew up in a very white town and all throughout high school. Before then, I had this idea of like Priscilla, what you&#39;re saying: what is the standard of beauty? And I&#39;m not that. So I had a lot of internalized racism about like as an Asian woman, you can&#39;t be pretty, you can&#39;t be beautiful. The only thing you can be is hardworking and smart. So when I started doing pageants, I just knew that I needed to stay within a system where I wouldn&#39;t be comparing myself to a beauty standard that I couldn&#39;t meet. Because in a lot of the more mainstream systems like Miss America, they are still looking for people who look a certain way and there&#39;s no way that you can change that. But even within Asian pageants, there are a lot of expectations for what an Asian woman should look like. And because Asian women are typically of like a thinner body type or you need to look a certain way, there are still a lot of expectations or stereotypes about how an Asian woman should look and like as a Southeast Asian - I&#39;m Vietnamese and Cambodian - we&#39;re often underrepresented in the larger like Asian / Asian international pageants. So I&#39;m often being compared to East Asian beauty standards. So I think that&#39;s just another thing to consider.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Yeah Savannah, I thought it was really interesting that you shared about how East Asian how Asian girls are supposed to look. I think that&#39;s one of the main reasons why I haven&#39;t joined a pageant that is for Asian-Americans, because for me, I&#39;m often compared to other Asian girls and I don&#39;t look like them because I&#39;m a little bit curvier.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />And like Savannah said, like they&#39;re all really, really thin, right? So it&#39;s interesting to hear that, you know, you don&#39;t want to compare yourself to other ethnic groups. As for me, I don&#39;t want to compare myself to like Asian Americans.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Da Eun: </strong><br />Yeah, it&#39;s really interesting. Switching gears, when you&#39;re going to participate in these beauty pageants, I assume you told your loved ones about these pageants that you&#39;re participating in. What was their reactions were like, did  their initial reactions change over time? I know you&#39;ve had to be more public about this with like posting a lot on social media about the competition and stuff. How did this play out in terms of reactions in academic and professional settings?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />When I first told my parents that I was competing in a pageant like when I was a sophomore in college, my dad&#39;s first reaction was like, are you pretty enough? And that wasn&#39;t even like - he didn&#39;t even intend to be mean. He was literally just like, you know, because of his idea of what a beauty pageant should be like or what any kind of pageant should be like. Like, are you setting yourself up for failure? So I kind of had to explain to them that, at least for the first one that I competed in, it was really focused on my scholarship. But then after after I competed in a couple and he saw that I was doing well and like enjoying it, my parents have really been like super supportive and are my biggest fans. Like they&#39;ll put my pageant pictures up at their store because they&#39;re tailors and they&#39;re like always tailored like this winning girl&#39;s dress! So they&#39;ve really come around.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />And I think like my close friend group in college has always been supportive and they&#39;re always like kind of making fun of me. They&#39;re like, you always say it&#39;s your last pageant, but when is it actually going to be?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />But in terms of like academic life, it&#39;s been an interesting because in undergrad, I felt like I could be very open about it because I was still young; as an undergrad, I felt like it was more okay for me to be like, yeah, that&#39;s something I do in my free time. Like this is something I do for fun and also for these purposes X, Y and Z. But as a PhD student, it&#39;s shifted a little bit where I was almost hesitant to compete again because I was like, I need to be &quot;serious,&quot; you know, whatever that means, and show that I&#39;m dedicated to my studies, to my research, to my practicums, and stuff like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />When I did compete again, I got some pushback from people in my program asking like, how can you say that you care about empowering women when you&#39;re competing in a system that inherently doesn&#39;t? So it&#39;s kind of interesting navigating that conversation and maintaining my academic self while also being like, no, this is a big part of who I am and I shouldn&#39;t have to defend my choices. But overall, I would say that people in my life really supportive. My boyfriend&#39;s actually the most supportive person. He like really encouraged me to get back out there and compete again. So I&#39;m really thankful for him because I wouldn&#39;t have competed in Miss Asia World if not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />So what is your stance on beauty pageants and how empowering they are? Because on one hand, I know that they have some pretty problematic origins, but I do see that a lot of pageants are transforming their criteria such that they&#39;re evaluating both appearance and a lot of non appearance-related things like talent and platform. So, yeah how do you talk to your co-workers about this?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />At least how I kind of frame it is, again, like I&#39;m very selective about which systems I&#39;m entering. At least with Miss Asia World, they&#39;re rebranding themselves as really a scholarship competition and academic competition, something that&#39;s, you know, really empowering women, especially Asian women. And that&#39;s how I try it frame it: depending on what system you&#39;re in, we are moving in the direction of trying to get away from solely focusing on appearances. But I think I think that because, you know, it ultimately, as you&#39;re saying, stems from these origins that are problematic and you are inherently being judged to whatever extent, like it differs by pageant, but you are being judged on your appearance.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Yeah. It&#39;s a really, really complicated and hard topic, right? Pageants obviously are super controversial, and like Savannah, I tend to look for pageants that really care about you as a person, as a whole, as opposed to just pure appearance. So like the Miss World system really cares about your Beauty with a Purpose, for example. And Miss World also got rid of the bikini portion and instead of that, they have a fitness challenge because they want to celebrate a woman&#39;s physique, not by how they look on stage, but by how they can perform in a fitness exercise.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />It&#39;s really hard to explain to people how complex pageants are because it&#39;s not purely</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"> based on your physique. I always view it as a celebration of different women and their ability to do great things for the world, but also their ability to really work on themselves. So yeah, I view it as that. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sexist game to play it. I definitely see it as a more of an empowering women activity.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Can I can I share my story about how my parents react?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Oh yes, please do!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />My mom is a very traditional Taiwanese woman who really wants her daughter to act like a woman. But I grew up as a tomboy and I&#39;m kind of a rebel and I always do things that they don&#39;t want me to do. So when I finally joined a pageant, I swear my mother could not have been prouder of me. Like, I graduated from an Ivy League. I work as a really, really awesome software engineer at a really great company and she has never flinched, you know?? But then when I told her I joined a pageant, she was like, &quot;Oh, my God, I&#39;m so happy and I&#39;m so proud of you.&quot; So that was kind of a funny surprise. I don&#39;t know if it was a surprise.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Why do you think she&#39;s so particularly excited about you being a pageant queen??</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />I think it&#39;s because it being a pageant girl forces you to act a particular way, to speak a particular way and dress a particular way. And she really likes how proper I look. Yeah...So that was interesting.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />And at my workplace: so I generally don&#39;t ever share my personal life with my co-workers. We also don&#39;t follow each other on social media so they don&#39;t know anything about me. But just last week at Happy Hour, one of my co-workers that I&#39;m close to, she told my entire team about my pageant life and how they can all watch me on Amazon Prime video now!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Really?? </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Yeah, you can watch me on Amazon Prime video! So she told my entire team and it was so sweet how supportive they were. Like they were genuinely super excited. And they&#39;re like &quot;oh my gosh, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m sitting next to Miss World Oklahoma, talking about APIs!!&quot; So they were super sweet about it. And I&#39;m just super grateful. I feel like I work on a team that has a really good sense of culture. They really, really allow their employees to do things that they love. So at work, we have like these fun activities that you can participate in. Recently, we had a Diwali celebration at work and one of my teammates went and did a Diwali dance. So I&#39;m really grateful that my company is super supportive of people having a passion outside of work.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br /> I&#39;m amazed they didn&#39;t know because you were traveling a ton and spending so much time on competing. So I&#39;m really impressed that you were so sneaky!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />It was really funny because like you like, hey, boss, I need two days off on this week. And he&#39;d be like, OK. And then nobody asks me where I was. So I just never told them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />And now they know. Wow. They must be also incredibly impressed. Wow.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />I actually wanted to bring the conversation back to something we talked about at the beginning, which is that you two both mentioned that you met amazing women through competing in pageants. So, Priscilla, I know that you went to a women&#39;s college and you support a lot of women in tech. And I&#39;m curious about both your experience and Savannah&#39;s experience. But Priscilla, I wanted you to talk about it a little bit from the angle of supporting women in your professional and personal life, but also competing really publicly against women in this pageant. So how did you actually end up finding sisterhood in this competition? And yeah. What is it like competing against other women in this way? </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />Yeah!! So that&#39;s a really interesting question: what is it like competing against other women? So I never saw it as competing against other people. I personally have always viewed this journey as competing against my past self. And I think a lot of the girls that I got along with are exactly like me: they&#39;re competing against their past self. After the competition, a lot of the girls went to look at their score sheets to see how they can improve next time. And when Miss World America was crowned, you know, all of us were really supportive of her. And we wanted to make sure that she feels supported because in reality, Miss World America, the girl who won, is the minority there, right? There are forty-nine other girls who are not Miss World America. So she&#39;s actually going to be feeling the most alone. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Whoa, that&#39;s such an interesting way of thinking about it!</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />So we definitely all hugged her and encouraged her. I think a few of us are trying to go to London to support her in December at the international Miss World stage. So to circle back to your question, it&#39;s really not about competing against other women. It&#39;s about competing against yourself. Because like I said earlier, there is no way for you to control what the judges are looking for on that given day, right? You can&#39;t control that. So it&#39;s really about how you can improve yourself on the stage, at that given time, and about how you can be a better person.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Savannah, do you think there was a similar mindset and culture in the four pageants that you participated in?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />I would definitely say so. Again, with being selective about the organizations that I&#39;m a part of, there isn&#39;t just like a drop off after the competition. Regardless of who wins, who doesn&#39;t get a title, there&#39;s still opportunity to engage with the community and keep doing what we&#39;re doing afterwards. So I think, again, like Priscilla was saying, you don&#39;t know what the judges are looking for that day. You don&#39;t know who they have in mind. So it&#39;s really about being your best self and knowing that at the end of the day, if you&#39;re proud of what you did, then that&#39;s success regardless of the outcome.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />And to close, I wanted to know whether you two think you will compete in a pageant again, and what is left for you to learn? I know, Priscilla, in your preparation, you practiced and learned a lot of things like how to walk for your competition, practicing your interview questions, etc. So, what do you what do you two think is left for you to learn through pageants? And, you know, given what you&#39;ve learned so far and what you hope to still maybe learn the future through pageants, would you encourage other women - high school and college-aged women - to compete in pageants?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br /> So I really want to learn how to inspire people through words. I had some problems with interviews at Miss World America. I tend to go on and on and on. So I really want to learn how to be really concise with my words and be really intentional with what I&#39;m saying. So that&#39;s definitely something that I&#39;m going to be working on for my next pageant.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />As for other women and whether or not I would encourage them to compete in pageants: I would say yes. However, I want people to know that they should be really, really secure about who they are before they compete in any system. For one of the preliminaries that I competed in, they also held a princess pageant for little kids in elementary school or in kindergarten. And I personally felt really uncomfortable being part of that because like in the backstage area, I was with all these little kids who are probably like five or six. And all they were hearing from other people was, &quot;You are so beautiful. I love your dress. I love how you walked on stage.&quot; And in my mind, I was thinking, do they know how smart they are? Do they know how much more they&#39;re capable of? So that made me super uncomfortable. And I want to make sure that whoever competes in pageants in the future, that they already know their worth and that they&#39;re not going to judge their worth based on the number of points they get at a pageant.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br />Yeah, I love that. That&#39;s such a good tip. That&#39;s such a good tip.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>replacd "pageant industry"</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />After competing in this last pageant, I think I&#39;m done. And now that I&#39;m in the second year of my PhD program, things are kind of ramping up and putting the prep work into pageants and being able to take time off isn&#39;t something that I really have the opportunity to do anymore. So I will be saying farewell to the pageant world, but still volunteering with these organizations. And also, Something that I&#39;m really dedicated to doing is helping girls who, like myself, come from lower income backgrounds and don&#39;t have the luxury of being able to afford coaching or all of these fancy dresses. I just want to know that pageants don&#39;t have to be expensive. There&#39;s a stereotype that you have to be of a certain income level to compete. And that was definitely something I had thought of when I had started. But there are so many people out there who are willing to help when whether it comes like borrowing gowns or helping you with your talents, mentoring you through stuff without having you pay a price. So that&#39;s just a little aside.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Savannah: </strong><br />And I definitely want to echo what Priscilla said about competing in pageants when you know your worth. I think if I had competed any earlier, it wouldn&#39;t have been the same enriching experience because I had a lot of doubts about who I was, about whether I could be pretty or not, even though that doesn&#39;t really matter. But I think if I had competed any earlier, I wouldn&#39;t have gained as much. So I think it&#39;s really important to recognize that a beauty pageant should be something that is beneficial to you, is something that you think you&#39;ll grow from, because there are so many other ways that you can grow and gain confidence that don&#39;t involve walking around on a stage. It&#39;s a very unique experience and something that I&#39;ve really enjoyed and I&#39;ve gotten friends to compete as well. But it&#39;s really up to you. And there&#39;s just so many other ways of helping the community that you can do without engaging in a system that has its ups and downs.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />I would say, overall, I had a really good experience. And like Savannah said, it&#39;s not for everybody, but if you find yourself in a position of line to challenge yourself and you know your worth and you have a really good system of support, I would highly recommend that you compete just because it&#39;s such a unique experience.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Priscilla: </strong><br />For me, it actually really resonated with my experience of going to a women&#39;s college because of that tight network of supportive women.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Sophia: </strong><br /> Thank you, Priscilla, for your parting words of wisdom and thank you so much for both of you for taking the time to speak with us today and for our listeners. We&#39;ll talk to you next time. Bye.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Convert audio to text with Sonix">Quickly and accurately convert audio to text with Sonix. </a></h3><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Convert mp3 to text with Sonix">Sonix uses cutting-edge artificial intelligence to convert your mp3 files to text. </a></p><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;">Thousands of <a href="https://sonix.ai/researchers?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Researchers trust Sonix to transcribe their mp3 files">researchers </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/journalists?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Podcasters trust Sonix to transcribe their mp3 files">podcasters </a>use Sonix to <a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="automatically transcribe mp3 their audio files">automatically transcribe their audio files (*.mp3). </a>Easily <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="convert your mp3 file to text">convert your mp3 file to text </a>or <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="convert your mp3 file to docx">docx </a>to make your media content more accessible to listeners. </p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;font-weight:400;">Sonix is the best online audio transcription software in 2019—it's <a href="https://sonix.ai/speed?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription with Sonix">fast</a>, <a href="https://sonix.ai/features?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easiest way to transcribe audio with Sonix">easy</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Cheap automated transcription with Sonix">affordable</a>. </h3><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;">If you are looking for a great way to <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="convert mp3 to text">convert your mp3 to text</a>, <a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embedplayer" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix: Audio and video transcription powered by cutting-edge AI">try Sonix today. </a></p></div><div class="sonix--embeddable sonix-embed" data-sonix-id="DDdiFCCsWkHngpdSKSzGFQxU" style="position: absolute !important;top:0 !important;bottom: 0 !important;left: 0 !important; right: 0!important;"><div class="sonix--javascript"><script type="text/javascript">
